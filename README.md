## Usage
* Drop the lab1/lab2/lab4/lab5 folder in ROS workspace
* Catkin_make and source the workspace
* Find the corresponding launch files and double click it
* For lab3 only matlab code is uploaded, it needs images to process
## Assignment instruction
* Lab1 designs algorithm for stage robot to avoid obstacles and chase another moving object
* Lab2 practices RANSAC to detect lines, and bug2 algorithm to reach goal position
* Lab3 uses Matlab to align RGB frames to obtain color images, including template matching and corner feature matching
* Lab4 implements Bayes filter to localize the robot given landmarks, sensor and motion models. Motion model is used to prediction position distribution(prior), sensor signal is used to update distribution
* Lab5 implements A* algorithm in a given map for a robot to plan path and avoid obstacles
